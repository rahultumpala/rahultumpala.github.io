Hello, I'm Rahul Tumpala.

I'm teaching myself computer science along with other amazing things.

In this blog, you’ll find posts about stuff I’m fascinated about and a few things in general.

The code that generates this blog is available in [gen.sh](./gen.sh). It's simple and minimalistic. No jekyll, no hugo and no javascript frameworks!
