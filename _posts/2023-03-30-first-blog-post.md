Thanks to Chad Baldwin for creating a github template repo that I used in creating this blog.

As I continue to study computer science on my own, I am going to find many beautiful things I'd want to write about and this is the place I write.

Currently, I'm learning how to write a compiler. Stay tuned for more amazing things.
