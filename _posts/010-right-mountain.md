# Are you climbing the right mountain?
July 21, 2024
Are your daily objectives aligned with your long-term goal? Do you have a long-term goal?

Everyone climbs a mountain in their life in one way or the other. Be it physically climbing an actual mountain or mentally in the form of learning a difficult skill. In either case, one ends up drafting a plan of action that they intend to follow.

Unbeknownst to you, you might have already done this exercise many times up until now. However, as life progresses, doing this exercise consciously becomes tougher. It becomes easier to get lost in the process of preparing to doing something than actually doing it.

With great determination if you actually persevere through the plan, how do you know that your steps and skills you learn at the end of each step are directly helping you in reaching your goal, without taking a leap of faith?

In other words, are you walking the trail that leads to the summit of your mountain? Or did you lose direction and end up in a different trail that's leading to a different summit?

**Are you climbing the right mountain?**

I'd like to share my objective point of view to this question, with a few illustrations to deliver my point.

I viewed the path to success in this manner.

To achieve my goal, I needed to learn certain things. To learn certain things, I need to follow a set procedure. When things I need to learn are many, I need to follow many such procedures to learn those many things. When these procedures are independent of each other, I need to do them separately, one in each step. Now the long-term goal still remains the same, but the definition of completeness changes in each step.

If you are already overwhelmed with life and work and yet you find yourself yearning to better yourself, you tend to give yourself a relaxed deadline for each step. This often means you will devote yourself to focusing only on the procedure to be followed for that step.

Your current objective to complete the first step in reaching your goal.

When the deadline is relaxed enough, you tend to focus on the nits and bits of the procedure, often to show your sincerity. While it is good, more often than not, it becomes the first stone that fumbles you in your climb.

Why?

The human mind craves perfection, you give yourself a relaxed deadline because you want to truly achieve something without cutting any corners. As sincere as you are, you devote your time and energy into the procedure and to truly cut no corners you study things in great depth, presuming you have enough time to reach your short-term goal.
